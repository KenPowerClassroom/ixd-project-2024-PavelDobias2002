                    Engagement: How 

                    engaging is the app? Is it

                    visually appealing? Does

                    it have sound and

                    animation to capture the

                    user's attention? Does it

                    have a good balance of

                    challenge and reward?

                    Kahoot is engaging for the user from the start, with distinct colours used for variety of options, it seems like there is something for everyone. The learning experience itself is engaging and fun. Trying to beat other students is followed with sound effects and animations, getting the correct answer feels rewarding.

                    The interface is visually appealing in its simplicity, but at the same time engaging. It doesnt need to be flashy and colorful to capture users attention, and in my opinion the overall feel of the website is calm and nice. Using the clouds animation to capture this.

                    User progress in challenges is tracked well, showing the total points at the end of every round. With hotstreaks to hype up your progress with sound and animations effects as bonus. It doesnt give you hints and you have to count on your knowledge or pure luck, this can lead to having next to nothing points with no help from the app to keep up with others. This can lead to frustration and sabotage from the user.

                    At the start of each lesson, there is a short video talking about the upcoming challange. The challanges itself uses animations and sound design to emphasize the user input. At the end of the challange there is star rating and accuracy. This makes the user to try have the most starts, learning more.

                    I would say that the user experience is good and easy to understand. Creating challanges and inviting others is easy to do. The app it self is ok to navigate in, sometimes it can get a bit confusing, but nothing to make the user leave. Overall the app is well designed, but not perfect.

                    This app is easy to use, the experience is fun and rewarding. When I first opened the app I exactly knew where to click to start lessons. The interface itself is appealing and engaging to use, making me want to go trough all the lessons and challanges.
