<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>Welcome to my interaction design project, focused on gamifying a learning app.
  Our aim is to make the learning experience more engaging and interactive for our user.
</p>
<p>
  Gamification is about applying game design ideas and principles to non-game contexts, such as education.
  With objective being, making it more engaging and fun to use, while motivating user to learn more.
</p>
<p>
This project involves various phases, to implement this. 
Such as:
<ul>
  <li><b>Competetive analysis:</b> <br> Helps us identify strengths and weaknesses in the existing market, highlighting areas we can improve.</li>
  <li><b>Wireframing and Prototyping:</b> <br> Allows us to design and develop the interface and user experience of the app, ensuring smooth and enjoyable experience.</li>
  <li><b>Usability testing:</b> <br> Conducted to gather feedback from users on the apps usability and functionality. Used to refine and improve the app, ensuring that the user needs are met.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Overall, our aim is to create a learning app that is not only effective but also enjoyable, ultimately improving the users learning outcomes.
